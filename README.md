Completed MEAN tutorial code, following the guidance of the tutorial https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial

##Description
This is my solution to the tutorial completed on the website above. This application is half of a CRUD (Create , Read , Update , Delete) application, seeing as you can create and delete. An HTML form uses Angular to grab data that a user inputs, sends it to a Node Server (largely written using the using the Express framework) which then parses the query to a MongoDB database. This is a great way to introduce yourself to the MEAN stack and learn all the complexities of dealing with Front-End through Back-End development. 
My other repository, CRUD-Repo, is a sample application using this same style. It isn't the prettiest, but it demonstrates the concepts well.
